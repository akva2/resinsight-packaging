This repository holds the packaging information for ResInsight.

Usage:

1) Clone this repository, to some folder, say ~/ResInsight-packaging
2) Put the original tar ball in ~/. An easy way to create a tarball
   is to use the archive function of git. Go to your clone of the
   ResInsight repository and type
   git archive --prefix resinsight-<version>/ <branch to archive> -o ~/resinsight_<version>.orig.tar.gz
3) Then run pdebuild as you would for the in-tree copy

Since this packaging involves some patchery, it will only be synced with
OPM coordinated releases. If you are unable to update it yourself, and
really need a new version packaged, send me an email.
